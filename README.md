# John Overton (@Overton77)

Full-Stack Software Engineer focused on **backend systems, cloud-native pipelines, and AI-integrated products**.

I build modern platforms that ingest unstructured data, transform it into structured knowledge, and expose it through APIs, agents, and user-facing applications — with a strong interest in **LLM/ML-assisted software**.

## 🔥 Currently Building (Next 1.5–2 weeks)

- Scheduling research agent runs for **entity ingestion** (people, businesses, products, compounds, lab tests, etc.) + **claims/mechanisms/pathway research**, producing the foundation for the web app  
- Adding **Knowledge Graph creation** and **Graph RAG tests** into the research agent to underpin the client LLM assistant  
- Improving pipeline reliability and tying together automation steps across ingestion → enrichment → API  
- Spinning up the **web app v1** 🎯

## 🚀 Featured System

### **Human Upgrade Platform**
A multi-service biotech knowledge platform that ingests long-form health content, enriches it via agentic research pipelines, and serves structured entities through a production-grade API — with an LLM assistant and client experience in active development.

➡️ **System hub:** https://github.com/Overton77/human-upgrade-system

**Core components:**
- **GraphQL API:** https://github.com/Overton77/humanupgrade-api  
- **Research + Ingestion Agent:** https://github.com/Overton77/humanupgrade-app-ingestion_research  
- **State-aware data pipelines:** https://github.com/Overton77/human-upgrade-data-ops  
- **Infrastructure (AWS CDK):** https://github.com/Overton77/human-upgrade-infra  

> This platform reflects the architecture I’m most excited about:
> cloud stacks → data pipelines → LLM agents → APIs → client experiences.

## 📊 Analytics, Growth, and AI-Agent Marketing

I hold the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate** and I’m deeply interested in the next era of **data-driven growth systems**, especially as marketing becomes increasingly **AI-agent facilitated**.

I’ve implemented real-world analytics and conversion tracking end-to-end — including building a full **Tag Manager → Ads + Analytics ← custom Shopify eCommerce event pipeline** for GoWipes to support attribution, funnel visibility, and optimization.

This perspective helps me build products that are not just functional, but **measurable, improvable, and designed for adoption**.

## 🧰 Tech I Work With

**Languages**
- TypeScript, Python  
- Async / concurrent Python (pipelines, workers, orchestration)

**Backend & APIs**
- GraphQL (Apollo), REST
- Express, Fastify, NestJS, FastAPI
- Background workers, caching, real-time patterns

**Data**
- SQL & NoSQL
- MongoDB (Mongoose / Beanie)
- PostgreSQL (Prisma)

**Frontend**
- React, Next.js, Remix

**Cloud / Ops**
- AWS (CDK, ECS/Lambda patterns, event-driven workflows)
- Infrastructure-as-code, deployments, observability-minded systems

---

## 🧠 What I’m Interested In

Building “living” software systems — apps that:
- continuously ingest and update data
- reason over structured knowledge
- connect LLM capabilities to real workflows
- evolve into assistants that support user goals over time

And building systems that are **instrumented and measurable**: analytics, attribution, and feedback loops that drive product improvement.
